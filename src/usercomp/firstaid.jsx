<br />
<p className='h2'>Treating a dog bite</p>
<br />

<p>If you’ve been bitten by a dog, it’s important to tend to the injury right away to reduce your risk of bacterial infection. You also should assess the wound to determine the severity.</p>

<p>In some instances, you’ll be able to administer first aid to yourself. In other cases, you’ll need immediate medical treatment.</p>

<p>Whether the dog is yours or someone else’s, you may feel shaken after being bitten. If you need medical attention, call for help rather than driving yourself to the doctor or hospital.</p>

<p>Read on to learn the steps you should take following a dog bite, and what you can do to prevent infection.</p>
<h1>Administer first aid</h1>
The type of first aid you administer will be determined by the severity of the bite.

<p>If your skin wasn’t broken, wash the area with warm water and soap. You can also apply an antibacterial lotion to the area as a precaution.</p>

<p>If your skin was broken, wash the area with warm soap and water and gently press on the wound to promote a small amount of bleeding. This will help flush out germs.</p>

<p>If the bite is already bleeding, apply a clean cloth to the wound and gently press down to stop the flow. Follow up with an application of antibacterial lotion and cover with a sterile bandage.</p>

<p>All dog bite wounds, even minor ones, should be monitored for signs of infection until they’re completely healed.</p>

<p>Check the bite often to see if it becomes:</p>
<ul>
<li>red</li>
<li>swollen</li>
<li>warm</li>
<li>tender to the touch</li>
</ul>
 <div className='blk'>
 <br />
 <h3>Treatment steps</h3>
 <ol>
<li>Wash the wound with soap and warm water.</li>
<li>Gently press a clean cloth over the wound to stop the flow of blood.</li>
<li>Apply an antibacterial ointment to the wound.</li>
<li>Cover with a sterile bandage.</li>
<li>Watch for signs of infection.</li>
<li>Seek help if you suspect infection or possible exposure to rabies, or if the wound is severe.</li>
</ol>
 </div>
 <h3>When to seek help</h3>
<p>Around 1 in 5 dog bites require medical treatment.</p>

<p>Always see a doctor for a dog bite that:</p>
<ul>
<li>is caused by a dog with an unknown rabies vaccine history, or by a dog that’s acting erratically or appears to be sick</li>
<li>doesn’t stop bleeding</li>
<li>causes intense pain</li>
<li>exposes bone, tendons, or muscle</li>
<li>causes loss of function, such as an inability to bend fingers</li>
<li>looks red, swollen, or inflamed</li>
<li>leaks pus or fluid</li>
</ul>
<p>Also seek medical attention if you:</p>
<ul>
<li>do not remember when you had your last tetanus shot</li>
<li>feel weak, disoriented, or faint</li>
<li>are running a fever</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to prevent infection</h3>
<p>Dog bites can introduce dangerous bacteria into the body. This can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections to occur when left untreated.</p>

<p>It’s very important to wash the wound as soon as you’re bitten and to use topical antibiotics, such as povidone iodine, in and around broken skin.</p>

<p>Keep the wound covered and change bandages daily.</p>

<p>Keep an eye on the wound for signs of infection. Depending on the type of infection, symptoms can start appearing within 24 hours up to 14 days after being bitten.</p>

<p>Infections can spread quickly throughout the body. If you notice signs of infection, see your doctor right away. You may need oral or intravenous antibiotics.</p>

<p>If your doctor prescribes antibiotics for you, you’ll probably take them for 1 to 2 weeks. Do not stop taking your medication even if the infection appears to subside completely.</p>
